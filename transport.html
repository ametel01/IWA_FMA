					<h3>Train</h3>
While there are not a lot of direct trains to Bergamo, it is well served via many hubs throughout Italy. Transfer in Monza to travel to Bergamo, there are several options depending on day and time. There is no need to book tickets in advance online, however, there are often good advance discount tickets available for the faster trains, but there are no advance discounts for Regionale trains. Online savings can be very considerable but the tickets do tie you to a specific date and departure time.

					<h3>Bus</h3>
Most public transport in Bergamo is done by city buses. The major lines run every 10 minutes in the daytime, very convenient. To visitors, the bus line 1 A is the most important one. These buses run from the train station along the main street axis of Città Bassa, via the bottom station of the funicular.
